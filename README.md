# vim-code-dark
[This vim-code-dark with small changes.](https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark).

Differences include:

* I changed the colour for special characters, so that whitespace with `:set list` enabled looks the same it does on VS Code with `editor.renderWhitespace`.
* I fixed the airline bar to look more like the bar in VS code. Now You can actually read the filename and encoding!
